# Finance dashboard with Tableau

## Problem statement:

In this project, you will create a comprehensive company finance dashboard using Tableau.
You have data on revenue, profit/loss, operational insights, expenses, current assets, 
liabilities, and cash flow â€“ the vital components that drive the financial heartbeat of a company.
You have to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard that offers a bird's eye view of the company's financial health. 
Dive deep into the numbers, transforming raw data into insightful visualizations that empower decision-makers to glean actionable insights at a glance. 
Consider employing interactive elements, intuitive design, and a blend of charts, graphs, and tables to deliver a compelling narrative.
